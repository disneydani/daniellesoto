        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Hello world, I'm Danielle. I am learning about web development and this is my first websites. I live in Squamish, BC. I am a proud Squamish Nation member. I learned over the years that I am more of an introverted person. I like spending time with my family, pets and my boyfriend. My cat is named Binx she is an orange tabby. My boyfriend’s dog is named Tyr and he is a mix of white German shepherd and Malamute. 
            I also like being apart of my indigenous Squamish community as much as I can. For example, doing cultural workshops like drum making, traditional medicine , or doing a group fitness class at Totem Hall. I have been working with youth on the autism spectrum since 2017, so 7 years now.  I would like to transition careers into Tech. That is why I am here at FNCT and I took the fundaments program and now this foundations program. With these programs offered here at FNTC I want to be able to get an entry level job in the tech industry. I would love to be able to work from home or have a hybrid job where I go into the office some days and work from home other days. This is my personal website where I share some of my interests and hobbies. I hope you enjoy it.
